## Customer Churn Prediction - Bank

- Financial institutions have many clients close their accounts or migrate to other institutions.As a result, this has made a significant hole in sales and may significantly impact yearly revenues for the current fiscal year, leading stocks to plummet and market value to fall by a decent percentage.

- The objective of this project is that we want to build a model to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the customers who are going to churn soon.

- A customer having closed all their active accounts with the bank is said to have churned. Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for six months or one year can also be defined as churned based on the business requirements.
