Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for six months or one year can also be defined as churned based on the business requirements.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7d6b0527","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002251,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:40:46.900072","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:40:46.897821","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
