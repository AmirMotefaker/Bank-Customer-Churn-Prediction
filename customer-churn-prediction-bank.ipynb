Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for six months or one year can also be defined as churned based on the business requirements.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"df8d8676","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001821,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:30:54.587545","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:30:54.585724","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
