Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for six months or one year can also be defined as churned based on the business requirements.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"53b2e16d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001636,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:10:55.294337","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:10:55.292701","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"447d13b1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-09T11:10:55.301147Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-09T11:10:55.300469Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-09T11:10:58.181037Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-09T11:10:58.179678Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.888023,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:10:58.184319","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:10:55.296296","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style type='text/css'>\n",".datatable table.frame { margin-bottom: 0; }\n",".datatable table.frame thead { border-bottom: none; }\n",".datatable table.frame tr.coltypes td {  color: #FFFFFF;  line-height: 6px;  padding: 0 0.5em;}\n",".datatable .bool    { background: #DDDD99; }\n",".datatable .object  { background: #565656; }\n",".datatable .int     { background: #5D9E5D; }\n",".datatable .float   { background: #4040CC; }\n",".datatable .str     { background: #CC4040; }\n",".datatable .time    { background: #40CC40; }\n",".datatable .row_index {  background: var(--jp-border-color3);  border-right: 1px solid var(--jp-border-color0);  color: var(--jp-ui-font-color3);  font-size: 9px;}\n",".datatable .frame tbody td { text-align: left; }\n",".datatable .frame tr.coltypes .row_index {  background: var(--jp-border-color0);}\n",".datatable th:nth-child(2) { padding-left: 12px; }\n",".datatable .hellipsis {  color: var(--jp-cell-editor-border-color);}\n",".datatable .vellipsis {  background: var(--jp-layout-color0);  color: var(--jp-cell-editor-border-color);}\n",".datatable .na {  color: var(--jp-cell-editor-border-color);  font-size: 80%;}\n",".datatable .sp {  opacity: 0.25;}\n",".datatable .footer { font-size: 9px; }\n",".datatable .frame_dimensions {  background: var(--jp-border-color3);  border-top: 1px solid var(--jp-border-color0);  color: var(--jp-ui-font-color3);  display: inline-block;  opacity: 0.6;  padding: 1px 10px 1px 5px;}\n","</style>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import subprocess  # Subprocess in Python is a module used to run new codes and applications by creating new processes.\n","import joblib  # Lightweight pipelining with Python functions\n","\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_graphviz\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report \n","\n","# A fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting (GBT, GBDT, GBRT, GBM or MART) framework \n","# based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks.\n","from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n","\n","# Get multiple outputs in the same cell\n","from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell\n","InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = \"all\"\n","\n","# Ignore all warnings\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)\n","\n","pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":14.131956,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:10:59.110302","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:10:44.978346","version":"2.3.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
