Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for six months or one year can also be defined as churned based on the business requirements.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8ca56900","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001656,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:28:46.556242","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:28:46.554586","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0e4a10c4","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-09T11:28:46.562723Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-09T11:28:46.561488Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-09T11:28:48.562627Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-09T11:28:48.561819Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.007434,"end_time":"2023-01-09T11:28:48.565425","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-09T11:28:46.557991","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style type='text/css'>\n",".datatable table.frame { margin-bottom: 0;
